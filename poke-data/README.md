# PokeData Application

## Description

This is my pokedata app. In this app you will find information on the first eight gyms in the Gold & Silver pokemon games.  
I created this with two goals in mind:

1. Simplicity
2. Ease of use

I wanted something that any user to could use to quickly look up information to know what to expect for any of the first eight gym battles. I acheived this by breaking up the information into just two pages. The first page gives an overview of the gyms. Where they are, what badges you earn, rewards, & most crucially what pokemon the gym leader has on his or her team. The pokemon have their own page dedicated to them. On the pokemon page you'll find every pokemon that you're challenged with in a gym battle. You'll find  
information on their level, type, what moves they use & more.

The inspiration came from a website called Serebii. They have a page that displays really useful information for all sixteen gyms,  
but I noticed their site doesn't seem the most mobile friendly so I decided to make an app that achieved the same thing, but was  
more mobile friendly & straightforward.
