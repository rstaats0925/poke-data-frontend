      Welcome to Poke data! Here you can look up any of the nearly 1,000
      pokemon. This is a single location that you can go to in order to look up
      the statistics of any particular pokemon. Navigate to the pokemon cards by
      clicking the "see pokemon button". Select the filter you'd like to apply
      in the "filter" drop down menu & then click "Go!" to apply it & see only
      the pokemon from that generation, or all of them if you choose. If you
      know what pokemon specifically that you're looking for use the search bar
      by typing in the pokemon's name.
